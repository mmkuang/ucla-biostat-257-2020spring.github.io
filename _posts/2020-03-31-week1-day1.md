Welcome to Biostat 257: *Statistical Computing*. 

## Today

* Course introduction, logistics.

* Computer languages.

* Introduction to Julia programming.

## Course material

* All course material (lectures, homeworks, ...) is available in GitHub repo <https://github.com/ucla-biostat-257-2020spring/ucla-biostat-257-2020spring.github.io>  

  To get a copy:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ucla-biostat-257-2020spring/ucla-biostat-257-2020spring.github.io.git
```  
  To update the course materials, issue  
```bash
git pull
```
within the `ucla-biostat-257-2020spring.github.io` folder.   
  To take notes during class, you can work on the Jupyter Notebook directly.  

## Jupyter Notebooks

All lecture notes are Jupyter Notebooks. It is a good idea to learn by running through the code examples. You can do this in several ways. 

### Run locally on your own computer

1. Download and install Julia v1.4.0 from <https://julialang.org/downloads/>.

2. Git clone the course material.   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ucla-biostat-257-2020spring/ucla-biostat-257-2020spring.github.io.git
```

3. Enter the folder `ucla-biostat-257-2020spring.github.io.git` on Terminal. 

4. Open Julia within that folder, type `]` to enter the package mode, then type  
```julia  
activate .
resolve
```
to install necessary packages. 

5. In Julia REPL, type  
```julia  
using IJulia
jupyterlab(dir=pwd())
```
to open the JupyterLab in browser.

6. Course material is updated frequently. Remember to `git pull` to obtain the most recent material. 

### Run in Binder

Binder is a free service that allows us to run Jupyter Notebooks in cloud. If you are having trouble setting up the environment on your computer locally, you can try running the notebooks in Binder. Follow the Binder link at <https://ucla-biostat-257-2020spring.github.io/schedule.html>. 

### JupyterHub at UCLA

TBD.
